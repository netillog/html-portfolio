<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Netillo Granados and I've been in the service engineering 
department at various telematics companies for over 15 years. I am 
passionate about python and web development as well. I also love to tinker 
with Raspberry Pi projects.</p>
<p>I love to skydive! It's the single most exciting thing I've ever done 
and I will continue to do it forever. My favorite place to skydive is Go Jump Oceanside. The combination of 
mountains and ocean views are amazing.</p>
<p>I also like to meditate and take ice baths at home. I'm considering purchasing the Monroe Institute's Holosync 
meditation program to help me meditate more effectively.</p>
